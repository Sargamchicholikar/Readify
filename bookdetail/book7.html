      <h2>The Gita</h2>
      <h4><span>Author:</span>Anant Pai
      </h4><hr>
      <p>The Gita or The Bhagavad Gita is a philosophical exposition that was presented by Lord Krishna. It is in the form of a dialogue between Krishna and his close friend Arjuna. This conversation took place in the middle of a battlefield with the two sides arrayed for war.

        <br>The Gita (Amar Chitra Katha) is a comic book presentation of the work and is at an introductory level appropriate for younger readers. Amar Chitra Katha is a popular comic book series in India, and it mainly presents tales from Indian epics, the Puranas, and classical works.
        
        <br>The Gita (Amar Chitra Katha) presents the profound philosophy of the Bhagawad Gita at a basic level for young readers. The script writers had the help of Sri CHinmayananda and His Holiness Swami Ranganathananda in deciding what to include and how to present it.
        
        <br>The philosophy of the Gita draws on older works like the Upanishads. The Gita provides a crisp and practical philosophy that is very flexible in allowing for many interpretations. As this might cause confusion in young readers, The Gita (Amar Chitra Katha) sticks to a fundamental presentation, allowing the readers to explore further on their own if they are interested.
